          <p>The country celebrates Student’s Day on the birth anniversary of legendary scientist, engineer and politician APJ Abdul Kalam today i.e. 15 October. Contribution of APJ Abdul Kalam to the field of technology is being reaped by thousands of scientists and engineers, and millions of Indians even to this day.</p>
      
          <p>Fondly known as the ‘Missile Man’ for the initiatives he took while he was associated with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) technologies developed by him are being used by the organizations even in present times.</p>
      
          <p>Dr Kalam was part of the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), which was set up by Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, father of Indian space programme. INCOSPAR, the team of rocket engineers of which Kalam was a part, set up the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) that is used by ISRO to launch sounding rockets even today.</p>
